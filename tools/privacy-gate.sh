# privacy-gate.sh -- scan this repo for identifying information before publishing.
#
# Run from anywhere:  bash tools/privacy-gate.sh [name ...]
# Exit 0 = clean, exit 1 = findings.
#
# THE ACCOUNT NAMES ARE NOT IN THIS FILE, ON PURPOSE
#
# Every other check here is structural: it knows the SHAPE of a leak
# (`Users\<something>\`, `S-1-5-21-<digits>`) without knowing your account
# name. That is what lets this script be published. But a bare `whoami`
# output -- one short word alone on a line, inside a ```text block -- has no
# shape at all. Nothing but the literal name finds it.
#
# So the names are supplied at run time and never written down here:
#
#   bash tools/privacy-gate.sh NAME             # argv
#   PRIVACY_NAMES="NAME OTHER" bash tools/...   # environment
#   printf 'NAME\n' > tools/.privacy-names      # gitignored, set up once
#
# The file is the one to use in practice -- argv and env only protect the run
# you remember to type them on. Matching is case-insensitive, so one entry
# covers both the Linux and the Windows spelling of the same name; list a
# name once per distinct spelling, not once per casing.
#
# Note the examples above say NAME, not a real one. An example is still a
# value: writing the actual name here would undo the entire point.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT CANNOT DO
#
# Three rounds of pattern-based scrubbing each passed clean, and each time a
# human reading the files found more. Every miss had the same shape: the SAME
# information rendered a DIFFERENT way.
#
#   round 1  matched S-1-5-21-*            missed S-1-5-83-*        (VM SIDs)
#   round 2  matched Users/<name>          missed `NAME:(I)(F)`     (icacls bare form)
#   round 3  matched S-1-5-83-<digits>     missed `NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\<GUID>`
#                                                 (same VM, resolved to a name)
#
# So: a clean run here means "none of the known shapes are present". It does
# NOT mean the repo is safe to publish. Read the files. Especially anything
# under wsl/storage/, which is raw icacls / auditpol / Procmon output and is
# where all three misses lived.
