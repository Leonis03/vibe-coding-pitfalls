#
# WHY RENDERING, AND NOT A PLAIN cp
#
# This repo is redacted. It says `<your-home>`, `<your-windows-user>`,
# `CourseName` exactly where the live copies say the real home, the real
# Windows account, the real course name. A plain cp is a bug in BOTH
# directions:
#
#   repo -> live   linux-cjk-font starts probing
#                  /mnt/c/Users/<your-windows-user>/.../SarasaTermSC-Regular.ttf
#                  No such file. matplotlib falls back to DejaVu Sans and emits
#                  tofu squares WITHOUT raising -- the exact failure that skill
#                  exists to prevent.
#
#   live -> repo   the account name lands in a public repo, and
#                  privacy-gate.sh stops it -- after you already committed.
#
# NOTE a literal `$HOME` in the repo is NOT a placeholder and is never
# substituted -- it is a runtime shell variable that ships as-is, which is what
# keeps set-deepln.sh working on a RENTED box whose home is not yours. The
# placeholder `<your-home>` is only for spots a shell never expands (JSON,
# Python string literals); see agent/skills/README.md.
#
# So: substitute on the way out, and compare the SUBSTITUTED bytes on the way
# back. Hash equality then means what you actually want it to mean -- "the repo
# is the live copy, modulo redaction".
#
# THE MAP IS NOT IN THIS FILE, ON PURPOSE
#
# Same reasoning as privacy-gate.sh: the real values are supplied at run time so
# that this script itself can be published. tools/.sync-map is gitignored, one
# `PLACEHOLDER=VALUE` per line, `#` comments and blank lines ignored:
#
#   <your-home>=/home/<your-linux-user>
#   <your-windows-user>=<the Windows account name>
#
# Matching is LITERAL, not regex -- no escaping, no anchors, no word
# boundaries. Longest placeholder is applied first, so one placeholder may
# contain another.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
#
# Only skills that ALREADY exist under a target root are touched. Installing a
# new skill is a deliberate act (and the two harnesses do not carry the same
# set); do it by hand once, and this script keeps it in sync afterwards.
#
# `deploy` mirrors: files in the live copy that the repo does not have are
# DELETED, because otherwise the hashes can never converge. Every deletion is
# printed. Run `check` first -- it lists them as `live-only` without touching
# anything.
