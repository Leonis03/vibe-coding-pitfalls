# Redaction and portability: how to write a value

*English · [中文（正本 / canonical）](redaction.zh.md) · back to [README](README.md)*

This repo has to satisfy two things that look contradictory: **no real usernames in the
tracked bytes**, and **every path still resolves on whatever machine it is deployed to**. The
method is to classify each value by *how it becomes a real value on the target machine* --
and the test is **whether a shell will expand it**, not what kind of file it appears in.

```

The two directions:

```
[PUBLISHING]  origin/main --> two public repos  (tools/publish.sh)
       |
       |  tracked bytes contain only forms (1)(2)(3) -- never a real name
       v
  privacy-gate.sh        the account names are NOT in the script: putting them
  reads .privacy-names   there would make the script itself the leak. Skips
  (gitignored)           tmp/. Covers known shapes only: passing != safe
       | pass
       v
  git archive origin/main | tar -x   whole tree -> vibe-coding-pitfalls
                                     agent/skills -> vibe-coding-pitfalls-skills
       +-- not cp -r: that copies the local private files gitignore was hiding

[DEPLOYING]  repo --> this machine (Fedora / Ubuntu / a rented GPU box)
       |
  +----+----+
  v         v
(1)(2)     (3)
plain cp   sync-skills.sh deploy, substituting from tools/.sync-map
resolved   verification compares the SUBSTITUTED bytes, so "hashes match"
on target  means "repo == deployed copy, modulo redaction"
```

| Class | Instances | Why it belongs there |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| (1) runtime variable | `$HOME`; the `"/mnt/c/Users/$USER"` first probe in `shell_common` | A shell expands it, and it is always right on the Linux side |
| (2) runtime detection | `glob("/mnt/c/Users/*/...")` in `cjk_font.py`, the globs for `WT_SETTINGS` and the `wt.exe` alias, fontconfig generation, `%USERPROFILE%` + `wslpath`, the `~/.cache/wsl-userprofile` fallback | No shell variable can give you the Windows account name |
| (3) placeholder | `<your-home>` in JSON (only two lines left in the whole repo), `<your-windows-user>` covered by `.sync-map` | A shell does not expand anything in those positions |

The design rests on two gitignored runtime files: `tools/.privacy-names` (the real names the
gate scans for) and `tools/.sync-map` (placeholder to real value). Both exist for the same
reason -- **keeping the real values in a runtime file is what lets the scripts themselves be
published**.

Three known weak spots, each with its own row in the [pitfall index](README.md#pitfall-index): the classification can be
chosen wrong and fail silently (`$USER` colliding with drvfs case-insensitivity); the fallback
cache lacked invalidation (now a two-pass self-heal); and the gate only covers known shapes.
